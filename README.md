# Advent of Code 2024 in Erlang

These are my solutions to some of the coding problems in [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com) using Erlang.

## Requirements

* Erlang 27 and up
* make (not strictly required)

## Usage

Make sure `erl` `erlc` executables distributed with Erlang/OTP is in `$PATH`.
Then run `make day$DAY`, e.g., `make day1`.
